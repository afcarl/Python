# To do

Play some more with data representations. Try again only e1 ... e2 type represenation which gave me F1=0.52

# Experiments

* F1 around 0.16 for <e> event </e> ... <e> event2 </e> ...
* F1 < 0.50 for <e1> event </e1> ... <e2> event2 </e> ...
* F1 0.39 for two words on the left of e and 0 words on the right
* F1 0.5236 2-word context with args enclosed in <arg1></arg1> and <arg2></arg2>
* F1 0.5266 same as above + learning alphabet from train+dev
* F1 0.5369 added a hidden layer after convolution
