# To do

Play some more with data representations. Try again only e1 ... e2 type represenation which gave me F1=0.52


# Experiments with CNN with contains/contains-1

Getting f1 for contains: 0.55186440678
all scores: [ 0.9728062   0.55186441  0.        ]

On WM GPU with these settings:

batches = 50
epochs = 3
embdims = 300
filters = 100
filtlen = 2,3,4
dropout = 0.25
learnrt = 0.0001

# Experiments with LSTM with contains/contains-1

Getting f1 for contains: 0.539354294155
all scores: [ 0.97029156  0.53935429  0.10397554]

# Experiments with LSTM (old data representation)

* Bi-directional LSTM, F1 = 0.4771
* LSTM with non-arg events marked as <e>...</e> F1 = 0.54885
* LSTM(64) / embedding dropout=0.2, watermelon, F1 = 0.5532
* GRU(64) / embedding dropout=0.2, watermelon, F1 = 0.5591
* LSTM with large number of epochs improves F1 for other relations but worse for Contains

# Experiments with CNN (old data representation)

* 06/15 ran cnn.py and F1 now lower than before (0.5). Investigate.
* F1 = 0.5462 for filter sizes 1,2 (is this best performance now)?
* F1 = 0.5158 for filter size 2,3
* F1 around 0.16 for <e> event </e> ... <e> event2 </e> ...
* F1 < 0.50 for <e1> event </e1> ... <e2> event2 </e> ...
* F1 0.39 for two words on the left of e and 0 words on the right
* F1 0.5236 2-word context with args enclosed in <arg1></arg1> and <arg2></arg2>
* F1 0.5266 same as above + learning alphabet from train+dev
* F1 0.5369 added a hidden layer after convolution

# Misc Experiments

* Binary classificaiton contains/none worse than 10-class
